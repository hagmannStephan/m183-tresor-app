# TresorApp
I wrote the documentation in the folder `tresorapp-doc` with Obsidian. It is mostly Markdown compatible so you can also check it out with VSC or similar.

However if you want to download Obsidian, it is a free [App](https://obsidian.md/), that I really like to use for documentations.

## Overview

To make the app safer, I implemented the following features:
- Password hashing
- User data encryption
- Captcha on sign-up
- Minimum password strength requirements
- Password reset via email
- Authorization and authentication via JWT token
- OAuth (Sign up via a third party such as Google)
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
