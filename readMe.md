🔐 TresorApp – School Project from M183
📘 Documentation

The complete documentation is available in the tresorapp-doc folder. It’s written in Markdown using Obsidian, a free knowledge management app.

    💡 You don’t need Obsidian to view the docs – any Markdown-friendly editor (like VS Code) will do. But if you're into clean note-taking and linking ideas, I highly recommend trying it out!

🔎 Key Security Features

To protect your data, TresorApp includes a range of security measures:

    ✅ Password hashing – your password is never stored in plain text

    🔐 Encryption of user data – sensitive information is encrypted at rest

    🤖 CAPTCHA on sign-up – defends against bots and spam

    📏 Password strength checks – ensures users pick strong, secure passwords

    ✉️ Password reset via email – easy and secure recovery process

    🛡️ JWT-based authentication – secure token-based login

    🌐 OAuth support – log in via trusted providers (like Google)

    🔑 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – adds a second layer of protection
